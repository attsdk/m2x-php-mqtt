# Contribution Workflow for M2X Client Libraries

If you would like to submit an issue or contribute to any M2X Client Library, please adhere to the contribution guidelines found here: https://github.com/attm2x/m2x-service/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

# Code Style Guidelines

We follow the highly valued PSR guidelines: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/psr-huh--net-29314

With the exceptions:

- Use 2 spaces instead of 4, for indentation.
- Opening `{` brackets should go on the same line as the function 


  ```php
  function foo_bar($param, $param2) {
  ```

If you have any questions about style, please infer based on the style used in the library currently.
